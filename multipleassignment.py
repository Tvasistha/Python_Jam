#multiple assignment : allows us to assign multiple avriables at the same time in one line of code. 

name , age , attarctive = "Toshi" , 30, True

print(name)
print(age)
print(attarctive)


# If all the variables have same value then it is defined by multiple assignment in a different way. refer to example below:

Prashant = Toshi = Billu = 28
print(Prashant)
print(Toshi)
print(Billu)
